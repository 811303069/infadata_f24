    "Because each row represents a single observation (one message), each column represents a single variable (such as sender, timestamp, or content), and the DataFrame only focuses on one kind of observational unit—messages—it complies with tidy data principles. This guarantees that the information is arranged for ease of manipulation, examination, and visualization. If the data about senders is repetitive and complex, alternative tidy formats might include putting sender information into a separate table."

    "  Alternative tidy formats could be making distinct tables for nested data, such as attachments or reactions, and making sure each has its own rows and variables. Another option would be to separate detailed sender information into a separate table that is linked by sender_id. A different approach would be to group messages based on time intervals, with columns for counts or other metrics representing each row as a time period. Depending on the focus, these formats simplify analysis and maintain data organization.\r\n"

    "  Example: A bar chart could be used to visualize the frequency of messages sent by each sender over time. The sender variable would be mapped to the x-axis, and the count of messages to the y-axis. Alternatively, a line plot could show message frequency over time, with the timestamp variable on the x-axis and the number of messages on the y-axis, allowing for trend analysis.\n"
